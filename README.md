Welcome to my Github! Here I share my scripts, my small projects in the world of automation and open-source. \
Former network engineer, currently SOC L2 analyst, motivated by Threat Intelligence and human behavior.

<details close><summary> About me üíª </summary>
Psychology, Criminal sciences and Cybersecurity, that's what distracted me, sometimes... I've been studying all the way to end up like you, doing the same thing in a loop. I am a SOC analyst by day and an OSINT scrapper by night. Otherwise I am an Archlinux user, as you may have noticed - The best functional distro to farm on Diablo IV (btw)</details>

<details close><summary>What if we live in a bunker ü™ñ ? </summary>
I mean, it's comfortable, away from noise, from the dictates (the real ones, those with weapons), from false experts, from false enthusiasts, from illogical and cognitive dissonance.</details>

<details close><summary> Any convictions üîé ? </summary>
We all walk to the same grave and the same death, we all go through the same bullshit, so as much as we help each other, right? If I can do anything in Cyber and network, and then share it with you, it's cool and it's been useful.

<details close><summary> Anything else? üíÄ </summary>
Manipulation and social engineering control the world ! Or not, maybe, really ? - I let you be spied on, probably no one has anything to hide.

<details close><summary> Environment <img height="18" src="http://wiki.installgentoo.com/images/f/f9/Arch-linux-logo.png"> </summary>
Archlinux, with my own mirror and network infrastructure. Strict network filtering, blocking everything I don't trust. I try to host all my services as much as possible, and I'm a big user of SearXNG and other free, decentralized, transparent alternatives, with no tracking.
