Welcome to my Github! Here I share my scripts, my small projects in the world of automation and open-source. \
Former network engineer, currently SOC L3 analyst, new CTI and Purple Team member.

<details close><summary> About me  💻 </summary>
Psychology, Criminal sciences and Cybersecurity, that's what distracted me, sometimes... I've been studying all the way to end up like you, doing the same thing in a loop. I am a SOC analyst by day and an OSINT scrapper by night. I work with Fedora SilverBlue (Atomic) on my desktop computer, Archlinux on all other devices (and servers) </details>

<details close><summary> Environment  <img height="18" src="http://wiki.installgentoo.com/images/f/f9/Arch-linux-logo.png"> </summary>
Archlinux, with my own mirror and network infrastructure. Strict network filtering, blocking everything I don't trust. I try to host all my services as much as possible, and I'm a big user of SearXNG and other free, decentralized, transparent alternatives, with no tracking.
